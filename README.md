# Simple_Platformer
A simple platforming game made with C++ using [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/). The structure of the code is loosely based on Christopher Herbert's video series ["Reconstructing Cave Story"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IufkC1IRY2Q&list=PL006xsVEsbKjSKBmLu1clo85yLrwjY67X).

## Features Implemented in Simple_Platformer
* Animated player sprite with walking, jumping, and falling animations
* Player movement based on keyboard input with momentum
* Tile based map that loads from file
