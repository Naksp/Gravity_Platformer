# Simple_Platformer
A simple platforming game made with C++ using [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/). The structure of the game is loosely based on Christopher Herbert's video series ["Reconstructing Cave Story"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IufkC1IRY2Q&list=PL006xsVEsbKjSKBmLu1clo85yLrwjY67X).

## Features Implemented in Simple_Platformer
* Animated player sprite with walking, jumping, and falling animations
* Player movement based on keyboard input with momentum
* Tile based map with support for multiple tile types
* Player collision detection (currently in progress, but basic platforming is working!)

## Running the Game
Run `make run` command in `Simple_Platformer` folder.

## Assets
All assets used in Simple_Platformer were made by me for the purpose of this game.
